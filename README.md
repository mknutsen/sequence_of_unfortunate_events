## Description

This is a Python program that allows the quick and easy creation of musical patterns that can be used with any midi synthesizer. 

### How to use
Numbers 1 - 9 switch the active midi channel between channels 1-9. These midi channels will be isolated from eachother and can be used to control different synthesizers separately from the same output stream.
 * M toggles mute
 * N creates a new sequence grid for whatever was last played
 * b increases and v decreases the tempo.
 * z and x increase and decrease the octave of the keyboard
 * r toggles an unquantized record of notes played in through the keyboard
